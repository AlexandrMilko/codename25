Problems:

Object forcing layout change (paintings x10, curtains x5, stairs(railing) x1, shelf on a window x2, drawer on window x1, fireplace x1)(Solution: remove these objects from masks)

Objects redrawn despite correct segmentation x5 (Try giving less freedom and less processing steps)

The algo did not pick the right image (bad featuring) x4 (write features extraction, create dataset, train ml model)

The algo did not pick the right picture from selected 10(vanishing point failed) x3 +x1 (only 1 vanishing point could be detected)(use neural vanishing point from github)

Issue with dataset x2 (248 bedroom, 99 living room)(change it)





Test 1:

wrong layout chosen because vanishing point failed

paintings over window

Test2:

curtains placed

Test 3:

painting on window

stairs not drawn correctly despite segmentation

Test4:

chosen the wrong image from top 10 even with nice vanishing point(maybe because there was yellow thing on it)

curtains, paitings placed

Test5:

paintings on the windows

Test6:

Test7:

great, just an issue with text on img 248 After bedroom

Test8:

scale

Test 9:

shelf placed on a window

painting, curtains misplaced

door was drawn despite segmentation

Test5(livroom):

chose correcly, but there were better ones in top 10
